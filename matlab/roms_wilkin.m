% John Wilkin's Matlab tools for working with ROMS files
%
% The up-to-date distribution of this code is kept at 
% https://github.com/johnwilkin/roms_wilkin
%
% There is some introductory documentation at http://romsmatlab.tiddlyspot.com/
% but most functions are well documented internally
%
% From time to time I will update the version of these routines available to
% registered ROMS users from the myroms.org svn repository:
% svn checkout https://www.myroms.org/svn/om/matlab/roms_wilkin local_dir
% but use github for the latest public version.
